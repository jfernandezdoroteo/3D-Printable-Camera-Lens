# 3D-Printable-Camera-Lens
3D Printable Camera Lens. The lenses used were taken from a pair of bioculars. The lens is designed with an M42 mount (for simpler 3D printing), to later be mounted on other cameras using adapters. Flange focal distance desgined like Nikon F-Mount cameras (aprox. 46.50mm), so it also may work with other DSLR and mirrorless cameras.
